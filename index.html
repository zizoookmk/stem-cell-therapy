        <p> Stem cell therapy
            Do you know what stem cell therapy is? How will it change life?
            To answer these questions, we should know the definition of stem cells. These cells are normal cells, but the only distinguish between them and other cells is the ability to differentiate into many types of cells. This means that the stem cells can be converted to other cells. If you understood the previous statements, you will be able to define stem cell therapy and answer the first question.
            Stem cell therapy is one of the new ideas that suggests using stem cell in medicine. To understand that we should know that the ability of the cell to differentiate is called “potency” and one of its types is pluripotent. The pluripotent stem cells are found in the embryo to differentiate into all the body cells. So, if the specialized cells were damaged or dead, we will suffer from serious problems such as damage in the tissue of an organ. We can solve this problem by injecting stem cells into the site of injury then they can differentiate into the cells of the missing cells in the tissue and treat this injury. The previous processes are the whole idea of stem cell therapy.
        Before starting, how did they get the stem cells? 
            There are many ways to harvest stem cells to use them in stem cell therapy. The first way is to isolate the cells from the patients’ bodies. We can also take them from other individuals and other species but there will be the risk of immune rejection (facing these cells by the immune system). So, the capable way to harvest the cells is the first way.  Even if stem cells are your own, there are still risks as will be discussed.
              Stem cell therapy has got different views between people. The first opinion says that this type of treatment is very effective, and it will treat most of the diseases. The main people who were with this opinion are the scientists and many people who tried it before. This treatment helped treat many known diseases such as leukemia and diabetes. All the previous illnesses are diseases that the biologist couldn’t find a specific medicine to treat it which clear the great ability of stem cell therapy to achieve that.
            What is the second view about this therapy way? Shall we know?
            On the dark side, stem cell therapy was very dangerous in the second opinion. Many organizations said that the type of treatment is dangerous for people’s lives even if they use stem cells from their own body. One of these organizations is FDA (U.S Food and Drug Administration) which prevents the use of stem cell therapy in any field except treating leukemia. Another group that is against the idea of stem cell therapy is the people who tried this treatment, and it made a negative result for them. For example, there was a person who used stem cell therapy, and he went to the hospital with tiredness. Then, the doctors discovered that there was a tumor in his spine. Also, there were (and still) many people injected with blindness because of the using stem cell therapy. As a result, these people filed a judicial complaint against the clinics that treated them by stem cells, and this makes bad news about using stem cells in treatment.
        Why is stem cell therapy not safe in these organizations?
        Let’s answer this question!
            The main reason for preventing stem cell therapy in big organizations is that this way of treatment can’t be tested with enough clinic experiences. That means if a new medicine is invented, there will be many clinical experiences to test the medicine to be sure that there won't be any mistakes or bad effects on the patients. So, in stem cell therapy, this way is not trusted because it is very hard to have enough experience.
            All these subjects can tell us about the understanding of stem cell therapy, but it still can’t tell us about the ability of us to use it in therapy. But we know that we will achieve this in the next years.
